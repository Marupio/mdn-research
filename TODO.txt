TODO LIST

The library code is now basically frozen, apart from debugging.
Here is a list of tasks that I'd like to eventually complete for the library.

Make Selection thread safe

* Propagate NamedEnum * THIS TASK IS ON HOLD FOR FURTHER ASSESSMENT *
    Logger::LogLevel, Logger::FilterType
    Coord::CardinalDirection
    Rect::FrontBack, Rect::RelativePosition
    TextOptions::AxesOutput, TextOptions::CommaTabSpace
    +library/Carryover.hpp
    +library/Fraxis.hpp
    library/Mdn2dConfigImpact.hpp
    library/NamedEnum.hpp
    library/NamedEnumExample.hpp
    library/PrecisionStatus.hpp
    library/SignConvention.hpp

* Propogate ErrorPolicy * ON HOLD *
* Propogate InputHandling * ON HOLD *
* Propogate new Rect iterabilitiness * ON HOLD *
* Change Mdn2dIO into a layer on the Mdn2d class structure * ON HOLD *
* Consider adding namespace extensions: mdn::algo (algorithm), mdn::io
* Get rid of invalidReason in Mdn2dConfig
* Make Selection thread safe?

* Check overwrite might be broken with if (d != 0) in Mdn2d::internalFraxis
* Change precision to fraxis depth, and allow infinite precision

GUI library
* OVER doesn't work on diagonals - don't get pascal numbers
* Be able to change config - config button
* New Project window lost [Enter] button
* Opens with slider all the way at the top
* SegFaults with math
* Operation Dialog always chooses to createNew
* Scroll wheel doesn't scroll window
* Ctrl+PgUp / PgDn triggers new blank mdn2d
* ProjectProperties->Back to default framework and blank Mdn2d numbers



---------------------------------

Bugs
* Drag tab drops after one position
* Cursor goes out-of-view on submit

Features
* Scroll wheel scrolls view when no other modifiers, sideways allowed also
* Copy,Cut,Paste clipboard operations not wired in
* Save only opens file dialog if path not set
* SaveAs always opens file dialog
* Hover peaks tab always
* Click Operation button, hover peaks tab
* After clicking operation button, click B tab, then dest tab, including + tab (i.e new)
* Add a '+ tab' which creates a new tab
* Shortcut keys:
    For these, Ctrl+letter->applies to Mdn2d, Ctrl+Shift+Letter->applies to Project
        N = New, S = Save, W=Close
    Standard clipboard operations
        Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Insert = Clipboard copy
        Ctrl+X or Shift+Del = Clipboard cut
        Ctrl+V or Shift+Insert = Clipboard paste

* Change operation buttons from text to symbols
* Add a gear button for ProjectProjectiesDialog
* Add a 'Clear All' button & edit menu item
* Update operation toolbar to make Destination more selectable
* Get rid of Operation->[opName] (in place) and (to new) menu items
* Carryover button
* Transpose button
* Negative button
* Invert button
* Scalar multiply button
* SignConvention button / apply to whole number
* Hover help text on EditMode, (Fraxis has it), Cursor location, Selection text
* Status area response output
* Wire up Help menu
* Wire up Edit menu
* Create and wire up Tools menu
* CommandWidget

FUNCTIONALITY

Start menu - New, Open, Recent
Problem with precision


Clear all button

Finish Selection cursor iterate functions
NDW::moveCursorAfterSubmit
    Convert to switch
    Finish putting stayInside functionality into it
Make Selection thread safe

CTRL+A highlights cursors 0 and 1 but not rect
ESC should remove rect selection, all at cursor1
Duplicating the same tab twice causes there to be two independent tabs with the same name
    Deleting duplicate tab is a crash
* Add number of digits with float / double add / subtract
* Add CLI-only features to LoggerConfigurator
* Click & drag tabs continuously, not one swap at a time * ON HOLD, MAYBE THIS IS OKAY *
Cursor input behaviour
    OVERWRITE
        All numbers entered replace exising numbers
        Entering a value that exceeds base causes carryovers that will replace existing numbers
        * Start editing by typing a number (or pressing F2?)
    ADD
        All numbers entered are added to existing numbers
        * Press '+' or num pad '+'
    SUBTRACT
        All numbers entered are subtracted from existing numbers
        * Press '-' or num pad '-'
    I want a status bar entry indicating mode: ADD + | SUB - | OVER

Restore leads to NDW digit grid being blank
"Save changes?"

Within-selection cursor movement:
    * tab + shift tab (right and left) wrapping movements within the selection rectangle
    * enter + shift enter (up and down) (same as above)
    * these actually do work on submission of digit text entry
    * outside of text entry, they do not work
Maximize seems to have no effect on cursor / axes position, i.e. it doesn't do the fraction stuff
Binary operation window 'Destination' radio buttons are messed up
Implement menus
Implement Save / Load Project
Implement Save / Load Mdn2d

DISPLAY
Move digit line to correct axes - currently they are out-by-one
Add a status bit of text below the digit grid showing cursor coords, selected area, etc.
For writing digits, get bounds first, then only call getValue within the bounds
Show digits within bounds darker than those outside bounds
Add a window / menu option to change the default config
There is currently no way to change the active fraxis setting
Resizing the digit grid with the slider works in making it smaller, but the calculation for bigger is a bit buggy, it seems to stick at the top:
    * slide up to near the top, cursor stays relatively in the centre of the view
    * slide down, cursor seems to think its ratio is "very close to the top", like 0.1
    * it still moves down, but definitely not in keeping in the centre
