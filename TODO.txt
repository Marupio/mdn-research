TODO LIST

The library code is now basically frozen, apart from debugging.
Here is a list of tasks that I'd like to eventually complete for the library.

Make Selection thread safe

* Propagate NamedEnum * THIS TASK IS ON HOLD FOR FURTHER ASSESSMENT *
    Logger::LogLevel, Logger::FilterType
    Coord::CardinalDirection
    Rect::FrontBack, Rect::RelativePosition
    TextOptions::AxesOutput, TextOptions::CommaTabSpace
    +library/Carryover.hpp
    +library/Fraxis.hpp
    library/Mdn2dConfigImpact.hpp
    library/NamedEnum.hpp
    library/NamedEnumExample.hpp
    library/PrecisionStatus.hpp
    library/SignConvention.hpp

* Propogate ErrorPolicy * ON HOLD *
* Propogate InputHandling * ON HOLD *
* Propogate new Rect iterabilitiness * ON HOLD *
* Change Mdn2dIO into a layer on the Mdn2d class structure * ON HOLD *
* Consider adding namespace extensions: mdn::algo (algorithm), mdn::io
* Get rid of invalidReason in Mdn2dConfig
* Make Selection thread safe?

* Check overwrite might be broken with if (d != 0) in Mdn2d::internalFraxis
* Change precision to fraxis depth, and allow infinite precision

GUI library
* Add shortcut keys & their descriptions
* Log idents are royally screwed up in Release mode
* New tab should select new tab, operations should select result
* New Project window lost [Enter] button
* Opens with slider all the way at the top
* SegFaults with math
* Operation Dialog always chooses to createNew
* Scroll wheel doesn't scroll window
* ProjectProperties->Back to default framework and blank Mdn2d numbers



---------------------------------

Bugs
* Drag tab drops after one position
* Cursor goes out-of-view on submit

Features
* Save only opens file dialog if path not set
* SaveAs always opens file dialog
* Shortcut keys:
    For these, Ctrl+letter->applies to Mdn2d, Ctrl+Shift+Letter->applies to Project
        N = New, S = Save, W=Close
    Standard clipboard operations
        Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Insert = Clipboard copy
        Ctrl+X or Shift+Del = Clipboard cut
        Ctrl+V or Shift+Insert = Clipboard paste
* Add a 'Clear All' button & edit menu item
* Negative button
* Invert button
* Scalar multiply button
* SignConvention button / apply to whole number
* Hover help text on EditMode, (Fraxis has it), Cursor location, Selection text
* Status area response output
* Wire up Help menu
* Wire up Edit menu
* Create and wire up Tools menu
* CommandWidget

FUNCTIONALITY

Start menu - New, Open, Recent
Problem with precision


Esc doesn't cancel operation button
Esc doesn't work in general
New tab should go *after* current tab, seems to go before


Finish Selection cursor iterate functions
NDW::moveCursorAfterSubmit
    Convert to switch
    Finish putting stayInside functionality into it
Make Selection thread safe

CTRL+A highlights cursors 0 and 1 but not rect
ESC should remove rect selection, all at cursor1
Duplicating the same tab twice causes there to be two independent tabs with the same name
    Deleting duplicate tab is a crash
* Add number of digits with float / double add / subtract
* Add CLI-only features to LoggerConfigurator
* Click & drag tabs continuously, not one swap at a time * ON HOLD, MAYBE THIS IS OKAY *
Cursor input behaviour
    OVERWRITE
        All numbers entered replace exising numbers
        Entering a value that exceeds base causes carryovers that will replace existing numbers
        * Start editing by typing a number (or pressing F2?)
    ADD
        All numbers entered are added to existing numbers
        * Press '+' or num pad '+'
    SUBTRACT
        All numbers entered are subtracted from existing numbers
        * Press '-' or num pad '-'
    I want a status bar entry indicating mode: ADD + | SUB - | OVER

Restore leads to NDW digit grid being blank
"Save changes?"

Within-selection cursor movement:
    * tab + shift tab (right and left) wrapping movements within the selection rectangle
    * enter + shift enter (up and down) (same as above)
    * these actually do work on submission of digit text entry
    * outside of text entry, they do not work
Maximize seems to have no effect on cursor / axes position, i.e. it doesn't do the fraction stuff
Binary operation window 'Destination' radio buttons are messed up
Implement menus
Implement Save / Load Project
Implement Save / Load Mdn2d

DISPLAY
Add a window / menu option to change the default config

Duplicate --> can produce two Mdns with the same name
Pressing '-' switches to Neg edit mode - should go straight into text line entry with a '-'
Closing all tabs leads to many crashable interactions
    Close tab button

Divios underway ... Done, click [div] to continue, [Cancel] to accept
