TODO LIST

The library code is now basically frozen, apart from debugging.
Here is a list of tasks that I'd like to eventually complete for the library.

Make Selection thread safe

* Propagate NamedEnum * THIS TASK IS ON HOLD FOR FURTHER ASSESSMENT *
    Logger::LogLevel, Logger::FilterType
    Coord::CardinalDirection
    Rect::FrontBack, Rect::RelativePosition
    TextOptions::AxesOutput, TextOptions::CommaTabSpace
    +library/Carryover.hpp
    +library/Fraxis.hpp
    library/Mdn2dConfigImpact.hpp
    library/NamedEnum.hpp
    library/NamedEnumExample.hpp
    library/PrecisionStatus.hpp
    library/SignConvention.hpp

* Propogate ErrorPolicy * ON HOLD *
* Propogate InputHandling * ON HOLD *
* Propogate new Rect iterabilitiness
* Change Mdn2dIO into a layer on the Mdn2d class structure
* Consider adding namespace extensions: mdn::algo (algorithm), mdn::io
* Get rid of invalidReason in Mdn2dConfig

GUI library

* Crash on close


FUNCTIONALITY

Finish Selection cursor iterate functions
NDW::moveCursorAfterSubmit
    Convert to switch
    Finish putting stayInside functionality into it
Make Selection thread safe

CTRL+A highlights cursors 0 and 1 but not rect
ESC should remove rect selection, all at cursor1
Tab | shift tab | enter | shift enter (t,st,e,se)
t|st
    Single-digit selection
        * movement: FAIL
        * submission: PASS
    Multi-digit selection
        * movement: FAIL
        * submission: PASS
e|se
    Single-digit selection
        * movement: PASS
        * submission: PASS
    Multi-digit selection
        * movement: PASS
        * submission: PASS
arrow keys
    Movement - should deselect and move - PASS
    Submission - should deselect and move - FAIL
* Add number of digits with float / double add / subtract
* Add CLI-only features to LoggerConfigurator
* Click & drag tabs continuously, not one swap at a time * ON HOLD, MAYBE THIS IS OKAY *
Cursor input behaviour
    OVERWRITE
        All numbers entered replace exising numbers
        Entering a value that exceeds base causes carryovers that will replace existing numbers
        * Start editing by typing a number (or pressing F2?)
    ADD
        All numbers entered are added to existing numbers
        * Press '+' or num pad '+'
    SUBTRACT
        All numbers entered are subtracted from existing numbers
        * Press '-' or num pad '-'
    I want a status bar entry indicating mode: ADD + | SUB - | OVER

Within-selection cursor movement:
    * tab + shift tab (right and left) wrapping movements within the selection rectangle
    * enter + shift enter (up and down) (same as above)
    * these actually do work on submission of digit text entry
    * outside of text entry, they do not work
Maximize seems to have no effect on cursor / axes position, i.e. it doesn't do the fraction stuff
Binary operation window 'Destination' radio buttons are messed up
Implement menus
Implement Save / Load Project
Implement Save / Load Mdn2d

DISPLAY
Move digit line to correct axes - currently they are out-by-one
Add a status bit of text below the digit grid showing cursor coords, selected area, etc.
For writing digits, get bounds first, then only call getValue within the bounds
Show digits within bounds darker than those outside bounds
Add a window / menu option to change the default config
There is currently no way to change the active fraxis setting
Resizing the digit grid with the slider works in making it smaller, but the calculation for bigger is a bit buggy, it seems to stick at the top:
    * slide up to near the top, cursor stays relatively in the centre of the view
    * slide down, cursor seems to think its ratio is "very close to the top", like 0.1
    * it still moves down, but definitely not in keeping in the centre
