TODO LIST

The library code is now basically frozen, apart from debugging.
Here is a list of tasks that I'd like to eventually complete for the library.

Make Selection thread safe

* Propagate NamedEnum
    Logger::LogLevel, Logger::FilterType
    Coord::CardinalDirection
    Rect::FrontBack, Rect::RelativePositiev
    TextOptions::AxesOutput, TextOptions::CommaTabSpace
    library/Carryover.hpp
    library/Fraxis.hpp
    library/Mdn2dConfigImpact.hpp
    library/NamedEnum.hpp
    library/NamedEnumExample.hpp
    library/PrecisionStatus.hpp
    library/SignConvention.hpp

* Propogate ErrorPolicy
* Propogate InputHandling
* Propogate new Rect iterabilitiness
* Change Mdn2dIO into a layer on the Mdn2d class structure
* Consider adding namespace extensions: mdn::algo (algorithm), mdn::io
* Get rid of invalidReason in Mdn2dConfig

GUI library

Why not track that here also

* Change the namespaces from simply mdn to mdn::gui
* Change Project's internal data treatment to use pair<Mdn,Selection>, instead of individuals
+ Add a Project::verify() function to check metadata is consistent
    It's in 'toc'
+ Add a getMdnAndSelection function, make getSelection's and getMdn's use it
    It's called 'at'


FUNCTIONALITY

When inputing a value at the cursor, if it has carry-overs:
    * the carryovers do operation+ on the existing values
    * the cursor location clears and adds the digit

Within-selection cursor movement:
    * tab + shift tab (right and left) wrapping movements within the selection rectangle
    * enter + shift enter (up and down) (same as above)
    * these actually do work on submission of digit text entry
    * outside of text entry, they do not work
Delete tab => seg fault
Maximize seems to have no effect on cursor / axes position, i.e. it doesn't do the fraction stuff
Binary operation window 'Destination' radio buttons are messed up
Creating a new Mdn2d causes a segfault
    * Right click tab, choose duplicate
    * Operations->Addition->Create New->segfault
Implement menus
Implement Save / Load Project
Implement Save / Load Mdn2d

DISPLAY
Move digit line to correct axes - currently they are out-by-one
Add a status bit of text below the digit grid showing cursor coords, selected area, etc.
For writing digits, get bounds first, then only call getValue within the bounds
Show digits within bounds darker than those outside bounds
Add a window / menu option to change the default config
There is currently no way to change the active fraxis setting
Resizing the digit grid with the slider works in making it smaller, but the calculation for bigger is a bit buggy, it seems to stick at the top:
    * slide up to near the top, cursor stays relatively in the centre of the view
    * slide down, cursor seems to think its ratio is "very close to the top", like 0.1
    * it still moves down, but definitely not in keeping in the centre
