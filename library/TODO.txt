TODO LIST

The library code is now basically frozen, apart from debugging.
Here is a list of tasks that I'd like to eventually complete for the library.

* Propagate NamedEnum
* Propogate ErrorPolicy
* Propogate InputHandling
* Propogate new Rect iterabilitiness
* Change Mdn2dIO into a layer on the Mdn2d class structure
* Consider adding namespace extensions: mdn::algo (algorithm), mdn::io

GUI library

Why not track that here also

* Change the namespaces from simply mdn to mdn::gui
