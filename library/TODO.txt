TODO LIST

The library code is now basically frozen, apart from debugging.
Here is a list of tasks that I'd like to eventually complete for the library.

* Propagate NamedEnum
* Propogate ErrorPolicy
* Propogate InputHandling
* Propogate new Rect iterabilitiness
* Change Mdn2dIO into a layer on the Mdn2d class structure
* Consider adding namespace extensions: mdn::algo (algorithm), mdn::io
* Get rid of invalidReason in Mdn2dConfig

GUI library

Why not track that here also

* Change the namespaces from simply mdn to mdn::gui
* Change Project's internal data treatment to use pair<Mdn,Selection>, instead of individuals
+ Add a Project::verify() function to check metadata is consistent
    It's in 'toc'
+ Add a getMdnAndSelection function, make getSelection's and getMdn's use it
    It's called 'at'


FUNCTIONALITY

CTRL + PGUP = next tab < these are backwards
CTRL + PGDN = prev tab
CTRL + SHIFT + PGUP = move tab right < doing this a few times --> segfault
CTRL + SHIFT + PGDN = move tab left

Tab should be move cursor 'within selection', tab loses focus
Same with shift tab
Enter + shift+enter should be 'move cursor within selection'
Delete tab => seg fault
Focus behaviour is annoying - should always be focused on digit grid.
Maximize should have origin in middle
Binary operation window 'Destination' radio buttons are messed up
Operations->Addition->Create New->segfault

DISPLAY
Move digit line to correct axes
Status line showing cursor coords, selected area
Show digits within bounds darker than those outside bounds
Need access to config
