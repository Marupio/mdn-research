## Project Properties

### Base
* 2 to 32 [default 10]
* the numerical base used for **MDNs**
* Entering digits, use 0-9, A-V as necessary.

>#### CAUTION
>Unlinke 1-dimensional numbers, there is no way to convert between bases of an **MDN**.  All numers will be cleared if you change the base.

### Precision

Precision gives the maximum number of digits from highest magnitude to lowest magnitude allowed.  Click the **Unlimited** checkbox for arbitrary precision, to prevent ever losing digits.

>#### CAUTION
>If you lower the precision, you may lose some digits from your numbers.

### Cascade

Fractional numbers exhibit symmetry breaking, and expand along only one axis.  In order for the normal mathematic operators to work, fractional amounts also exhibit a cascade, where they expand diagonally away from their parent axis to infinite.  The **Cascade** setting is the furthest limit this expansion is allowed to go.

### Fraxis

Fractional numbers only exist along a single axis, not both.  This is the axis along which the fractional amount exists.

### Sign

Ambiguous carry-overs lead to polymorphic numbers that have multiple valid forms.  The polymorphic **sign** is the positive / negative value at the polymorphic root number.

This informs the user what impact these changes to the properies will have on any existing numbers.
